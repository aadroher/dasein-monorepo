I'll help you implement Phase 1 of the feature. Let me start by running the prerequisites check script. Now let me check the checklist status: Perfect! Let me check if there are any other checklist files: Excellent! Now let me analyze the checklist status and display the results:

## Checklist Status

| Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
| `requirements.md` | 13 | 13 | 0 | ✓ PASS |

**Overall Status**: ✅ PASS - All checklists are complete

All checklist items are complete. Proceeding with Phase 1 implementation.

Now let me load the implementation context and verify project setup: Good! This is a git repository. Now let me check for existing ignore files and package.json to understand the technology stack: Let me check the existing ignore files: Good! The ignore files are already well-configured. Now let me create a task tracking list and execute Phase 1: Now let me execute Phase 1 tasks: Good! Heroicons installed successfully. Now let me verify the test infrastructure and mark T001 complete: Perfect! I can see that Heroicons was installed (v2.2.0), and the test infrastructure is already configured:
- Vitest (v1.5.0)
- Playwright (v1.48.0)
- jest-axe (v8.0.0)

Let me verify the test configuration files: Excellent! Now let me check the test setup file to verify jest-axe configuration: Perfect! All test infrastructure is properly configured. Now let me mark T002 as complete and update the `tasks.md` file: 
```

```
Perfect! Phase 1 is complete. Let me commit the changes: ## Phase 1 Complete ✅

Phase 1 (Setup) has been successfully completed:

### Tasks Completed

- **T001**: ✅ Installed Heroicons React package (`@heroicons/react@^2.2.0`)
- **T002**: ✅ Verified test infrastructure:
  - Vitest 1.5.0 configured with jsdom environment
  - Playwright 1.48.0 configured for E2E testing
  - jest-axe 8.0.0 integrated for accessibility testing
  - Test setup file properly extends expect with `toHaveNoViolations`

### Project Setup Verification

All ignore files are properly configured:
- `.gitignore` (root and web-client) - includes Node.js, build outputs, environment files
- `.eslintignore` - includes dependencies, build outputs, test results

### Next Steps

You're now ready to proceed to **Phase 2: Foundational** which will create the core design system components:
- IconButton component
- AppLogo component  
- PageHeader component
- CommonLayout component
- Accessibility and unit tests for these components

These foundational components will be used by all three user stories and must be completed before any user story implementation can begin.
