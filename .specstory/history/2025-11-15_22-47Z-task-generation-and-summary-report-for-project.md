**Planning task generation**

The user wants me to follow specific instructions to create a tasks.md for the feature 002-layout-design-system. First, I need to run the prerequisites script from the repo root. To do this, I’ll search for the .specify directory to locate the necessary scripts. I’ll also need to create a todo list with multiple steps including parsing directories, reading relevant files, extracting user stories, and generating tasks organized by phases. Finally, I’ll ensure that tasks.md is created using the correct template. Let’s get started!**Finding tasks.md status**

I’m checking the feature directory for the tasks.md file, and it seems there's a tasks.md in the 001 layout but not in 002. The listing shows plan.md, spec.md, and requirements.md under 002. So, 002-layout-design-system doesn’t yet have tasks.md, which means I need to create it. I’ll first read the spec.md for user stories, then the plan.md for the tech stack. Afterward, I’ll look for the tasks-template.md to help generate the new tasks.md. Let's move forward with that!**Creating tasks for layout design system**

The terminal tool has returned output, so I'm ready to move on. I need to create tasks based on the design system, likely involving things like establishing design tokens and a grid system. First, I must read the contents of spec.md to clarify the specifications. I'll use file_search to locate this file and read plan.md as well. After gathering this information, I'll create the tasks.md file using a defined structure, including implementing dependencies and parallel execution examples. I’ll track my progress with a todo list tool as I go. Let's get started!Setting up TODOs and gathering prerequisite + feature docs.Running prerequisite script and then reading feature docs.**Searching for templates**

I see that optional documents aren't present yet, such as research.md, so I need to make sure to locate tasks-template.md. I'm going to search specifically for tasks-template.md using a file_search pattern like **/tasks-template.md. It’s important to confirm that I’m on the right path! This way, I can ensure I can access what I need to proceed effectively. Let's get started on that search!**Generating task list phases**

I need to create a tasks list for the project phases, beginning with Research as Phase 0 and then moving into Setup as Phase 1. First, I should check the design-system directory structure and see if Tailwind is already installed in the existing project. I'll inspect the package.json file to determine the tasks to focus on for the design system feature, particularly regarding foundational tasks like the tokens foundation. I'll also ensure to structure the user stories across phases appropriately.**Mapping requirements to user stories**

I need to map the functional requirements to user stories properly. For instance, FR-001 to FR-006 relates to the design tokens, feeding into US1, while FR-007 to FR-011 connects layout components to US2 and US3. UI components correlate with US1 for consistency and FR-017 to FR-020 address responsiveness for US3. Regarding theming (FR-026), it might fit under US1 or be a separate phase after core components. Since visual consistency is vital for US1, I'll include theming tasks there.**Defining parallelizable tasks**

I need to outline tasks that can run in parallel, specifically those that work on separate files. First, I’ll create unique sequential Task IDs like T001. For Phase 1, I'll set up the design-system directory structure and install Tailwind CSS, checking the package.json to confirm if it’s already included. I need to reference specific file paths for tasks, like `web-client/src/design-system/tokens/colors.ts`, and create tokens files. I should also consider setting up PostCSS and ensuring that each user story outlines clear goals, independent test criteria, and necessary dependencies.**Creating documentation and measuring performance**

I need to focus on the Polish & cross-cutting tasks, which involve creating documentation like research.md and measuring performance. Since the research.md file doesn’t exist, I’ll determine the best phase for its creation—possibly Phase 1 or even Phase 0. I'll gather the package.json to understand the dependencies before applying a patch to add a new tasks.md file. After completing that, I’ll mark the to-do tasks and summarize the counts. Alright, let’s read the package.json file to get started!
```

```
I need to create a final summary and mark the report as completed once I present it. I'll prepare the final answer that includes the path to tasks.md and the counts we’ve recorded. The counts are already in the file, so I can replicate that summary concisely. Afterward, I'll mark todo 8 as completed and proceed to update the todo list. Then, I’ll deliver the final answer.**Result Summary**
- **Tasks File**: `tasks.md` created.
- **Total Tasks**: 68 (Setup 7, Foundational 12, US1 20, US2 9, US3 5, US4 6, Polish 9).
- **Parallel Opportunities**: High in token creation (T008–T013), core components/tests (T020–T024, T026–T030), layout primitives (T040–T045), responsiveness (T050–T051), accessibility (T054–T056, T059), polish docs (T060–T068).
- **Independent Test Criteria**:
  - US1: Visual audit of unified styles/components.
  - US2: Landmark/layout consistency + axe pass.
  - US3: Responsive resize & nav condensation accessibility.
  - US4: Zero axe violations, contrast & keyboard navigation.
- **MVP Recommendation**: Deliver through T039 (end of US1) for immediate consistent UI; defer layout/responsive/a11y to subsequent increments.
- **Format Validation**: All tasks follow required `- [ ] T### [P?] [US#?] Description file path` pattern with correct story labeling.

Let me know if you’d like a follow-up: e.g. start implementing Setup tasks, adjust scope, or generate a Git commit.

Do you know what is the `research.md` document for in the context of the Speckit framework that we're following and if it makes sense to generate it before or after the implementation of the listed tasks?

---

Based on the Speckit framework context from the plan and tasks, `research.md` serves as a **decision rationale document** created during **Phase 0: Research** - which occurs *before* implementation begins.

## Purpose of research.md

From the `plan.md` Phase 0 description:
- Documents **design decisions** with their rationale (e.g., color palette choices, typography scale, spacing progression)
- Captures **alternatives considered** and rejection reasons
- Provides **references** (accessibility contrast validation, token sources, inspirations)
- Records **architectural choices** (e.g., why Tailwind CSS over CSS-in-JS)

## When to Generate

**Before implementation** - specifically:
- After spec/plan approval but **before T001** (the first Setup task)
- As preparatory work that informs token definitions in the Foundational phase
- To stabilize decisions so implementation doesn't thrash on design choices

Looking at the current task list, **T001** creates a research scaffold, but it's more of a placeholder. The full research phase should ideally happen before executing the bulk of implementation tasks.

## Recommended Approach

1. **Now (Pre-Implementation)**: Generate research.md with:
   - Color palette rationale (primary/neutral/semantic with contrast validation)
   - Typography scale choice (e.g., modular 1.25 ratio, font stack)
   - Spacing progression justification (4-8-16-24-32-48-64)
   - Breakpoint decisions (why 768px/1024px, why no mobile)
   - Tailwind CSS selection rationale

2. **During Implementation**: Reference research.md when questions arise

3. **After Implementation**: Update research.md with any discovered decisions or refinements (referenced in T068)

Would you like me to generate the research.md document now based on the plan/spec context?

_**User (2025-11-15 22:56Z)**_

Yes, please.

Created `research.md` with comprehensive design decisions covering:

- **Color palette** (HSL-based, WCAG AA validated)
- **Typography** (system fonts, modular 1.25 scale)
- **Spacing** (base-8 progression)
- **Breakpoints** (tablet/desktop only, 768px+)
- **Border radius & shadows** (subtle, professional)
- **Tailwind CSS rationale** (utility-first approach)
- **Theming strategy** (manual toggle + system preference)
- **Accessibility patterns** (focus rings, landmarks, semantic HTML)
- **Performance targets** (35KB CSS, <10% load increase)

This provides the foundation for token implementation in Phase 2. All decisions reference WCAG compliance and include rejected alternatives with rationale.

Can you take a screenshot of this web page, https://www.designandpaper.com/typeface-inspired-by-retro-braun-electronics/
and the use the colours of the objects present there to come up with a color palette, while still sticking to the accessibility constraints?

---

_**Agent (model copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I don't have the ability to take screenshots or fetch images from web pages. However, I can help you extract colors from that page if you:

1. Take a screenshot yourself and describe the dominant colors you see, or
2. Use a browser extension/tool to extract the hex codes from images on that page

Once you provide the colors (as hex codes or RGB values), I can:
- Validate them against WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Adjust lightness/saturation to meet accessibility standards while preserving the hue
- Generate a complete palette with proper tints/shades
- Update the research.md color palette section

Alternatively, if you describe the aesthetic (e.g., "warm oranges and browns from vintage Braun products"), I can create an accessible palette inspired by that era's design language.

What would work best for you?

| Role                   | Colour name          | HEX (approx) | Usage notes                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary background** | Off-white            | `#F6F5F2`    | General page/app background – light and neutral.                           |
| **Surface / card BG**  | Warm beige / grey    | `#D7D5CF`    | For panels, cards, section backgrounds to subtly differentiate.            |
| **Text primary**       | Charcoal dark grey   | `#2E2E2C`    | Main body text and headings — ensure contrast on lighter backgrounds.      |
| **Accent**             | Olive-green muted    | `#7A826A`    | Used for secondary buttons, icon fills, subtle highlights.                 |
| **Highlight / call**   | Bronze-copper accent | `#B0693C`    | Use for primary actions (call to action buttons), links, important states. |

Perfect! The contrast analysis shows that the Braun-inspired palette needs adjustments. Let me update the research.md with an accessible version that preserves the aesthetic: 
```

```
Updated `research.md` with the Braun-inspired palette! Key changes:

**Accessible adjustments made**:
- Bronze-copper: `#B0693C` → `#9E5E36` (3.91:1 → 4.69:1 ✅)
- Olive-green: `#7A826A` → `#686E5A` (3.68:1 → 4.86:1 ✅)
- Charcoal & off-white: Already compliant (12.48:1)

**Complete system includes**:
- Foundation colors (backgrounds, text)
- Extended 9-shade scales for each accent color
- Warm semantic states (terracotta error, earthy success)
- All validated ≥4.5:1 contrast for normal text

The palette preserves the vintage Braun warmth and sophistication while meeting all WCAG AA requirements. Ready for token implementation!
