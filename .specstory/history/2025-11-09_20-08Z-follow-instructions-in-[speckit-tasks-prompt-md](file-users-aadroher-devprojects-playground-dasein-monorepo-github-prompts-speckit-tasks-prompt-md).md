**Planning file reading**

I’m thinking of guessing up to 400 lines, which is quite generous! To play it safe, I’ll set my line range for reading the file from 1 to 400. Let’s get this organized! First, I’ll write a to-do list, so I can track what needs to be done. After that, I’ll batch the tools I need to use, then I can proceed with the reading task. Sounds straightforward!
