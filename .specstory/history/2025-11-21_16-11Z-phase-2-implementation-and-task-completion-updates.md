I'll follow the instructions in the speckit.implement.prompt.md file to execute Phase 2 of the implementation.

Let me start by running the prerequisites check script: Now let me check if there are checklists to validate: Excellent! The checklist shows all items are complete (12 total, 12 completed, 0 incomplete). Let me now load the implementation context: Now let me read the contracts and quickstart: Perfect! Now I have all the context I need. Let me create a todo list for Phase 2 and begin implementation: Now let me check the current project structure to understand existing patterns: Let me check the existing button component to understand patterns: Now let me check test patterns: Perfect! Now I understand the patterns. Let me start implementing Phase 2. I'll begin with the parallel tasks (T003, T004, T005, T007, T008, T009, T010), then T006 after T004 and T005 complete.

Let me update the todo and start with T003: Now let me create all the components and tests in parallel. I'll create them all at once: I need to fix the aria-hidden type error: 
```

```
Now let me create the CommonLayout component (T006 - depends on T004 and T005): Now let me create all the test files. First the unit tests: Now let me create the accessibility tests: Great! Now let me update the design system index to export these new components: Now let me update these index files to export the new components: 
```

```

```

```
Perfect! Now let me run the tests to make sure everything works: Excellent! Let me test the CommonLayout: Great! Now let me test the accessibility tests: Perfect! All tests are passing. Now let me update the todo list and mark these tasks as complete, then update the `tasks.md` file: Now let me update the `tasks.md` file to mark all Phase 2 tasks as complete: [object Object]

Perfect! Now let me check if there are any linting errors and commit the changes: Excellent! Let me commit these changes: Perfect! Phase 2 is complete. Let me provide a summary of what was accomplished:

## Phase 2 Complete ✅

**Status**: All foundational design system components successfully implemented and tested.

### Components Created:

1. **IconButton** (`icon-button.tsx`)
   - Accessible icon-only button with ARIA labels
   - Primary and danger variants
   - Minimum 44x44px touch targets (WCAG AA)
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - 17 unit tests + 11 accessibility tests = **28 tests passing**

2. **AppLogo** (`app-logo.tsx`)
   - Dasein branding with SVG logo
   - Accessible text label
   - Screen reader context ("Dasein - Educational Schedule Management")

3. **PageHeader** (`page-header.tsx`)
   - Standardized h2 page-level heading
   - Consistent typography

4. **CommonLayout** (`common-layout.tsx`)
   - Reusable application shell
   - Fixed header with logo
   - Flexible content area
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - 10 unit tests + 15 accessibility tests = **25 tests passing**

### Test Results:
- **Total tests created**: 53
- **All tests passing**: ✅ 53/53 (100%)
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**: ✅ Verified via jest-axe

### Files Modified:
- **Components**: 4 new components
- **Tests**: 4 test files (2 unit, 2 accessibility)
- **Exports**: Updated design system index files
- **Tasks**: Updated `tasks.md` with completed checkmarks

### Next Steps:
The foundational phase is complete. You can now proceed with:
- **Phase 3**: User Story 1 - Teacher list layout redesign (T011-T022)
- **Phase 4**: User Story 2 - Common header integration (T023-T031)
- **Phase 5**: User Story 3 - Form spacing improvements (T032-T037)

All foundational components are ready and available for use in the feature implementation phases.
