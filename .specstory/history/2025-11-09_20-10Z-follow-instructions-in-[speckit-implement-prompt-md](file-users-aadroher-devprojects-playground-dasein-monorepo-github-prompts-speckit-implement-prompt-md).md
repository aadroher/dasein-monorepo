**Checking prerequisites for implementation**

The user wants to implement a prompt with Speckit, so I need to start by running the prerequisites script. First, I need to check if the script exists in the .specify directory, but I don’t see it listed in the workspace, which suggests it might be missing. I should use a file search to verify and provide a to-do list. Then, I'll need to read the tasks.md file and check for the feature directory before parsing checklist items.**Organizing task execution process**

I need to open the contract files: openapi.yaml and teacher-operations.md, and create ignore files to verify the environment. First, I'll run a git rev-parse using the terminal to check existing ignore files in the root directory. I’ll list the root directory structure to identify what’s already there. 

Next, I need to implement tasks from tasks.md. I'll manage a to-do list for tracking this multi-step process. The initial to-do items would include running prerequisites, parsing checklist statuses, reading various files, and executing implementation tasks in order, marking them as completed when done.**Planning file reads and parallel execution**

I'm cautious about making significant code modifications since the tasks might describe features that haven't been implemented yet. I noticed some code regarding the teacher sort service and storage adapters, which may indicate partial implementation. So, I’ll proceed with reading various files, using multiple tool calls.

I'll start with file searches and directory listings to establish what’s available. We can read checklist files and several markdown files simultaneously. Since I don’t know each file’s length, I might set a high end-line number at 500; if they're shorter, truncation will be okay. First, I’ll list all relevant directories to gather filenames before diving into the content.**Parsing checklist and managing implementation**

I need to read the checklist file and parse the items, looking for "- [ ]" to identify incomplete items. If the checklist has no items or incomplete ones, I must stop and seek the user's consent before moving forward. I’ll start by creating a to-do list for managing tasks, then perform a batch of tool calls for discovery, including directory listings and file searches.

Once I summarize the checklist results, if it's incomplete, I'll ask the user how to proceed. I should hold off on reading tasks or any other files until I confirm the checklist status. It seems I can't load the context until I have user consent if there are incomplete items.**Implementing checklist reading process**

I need to focus on reading only the checklist file first, not the tasks. So, my initial step will be to locate the feature directory and then read the checklist file. I also need information about the prerequisites script. If the .specify path is missing, we'll run into replication errors, and I’ll need to manually determine the FEATURE_DIR and available documents.

I should run the command for prerequisites as per the instructions: "Run .specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks." This could produce an error, but I’ll handle it gracefully. My sequence of tool calls includes creating a to-do list, running the prerequisites script, searching for the .specify path, listing the feature directory and its subfolders, and finally reading the checklist file. Now, I just need to implement these steps!Creating initial task list and gathering prerequisite script, feature directory contents, and checklist file to compute checklist status before proceeding.
