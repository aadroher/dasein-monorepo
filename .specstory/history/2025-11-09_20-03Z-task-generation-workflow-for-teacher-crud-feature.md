I'll help you generate a project structure for the Teacher CRUD feature. However, I notice that you're asking me to execute a complex task generation workflow, which goes beyond my role as a directory structure assistant.

My primary function is to suggest filetree directory structures for projects. The task you're describing involves:

- Running bash scripts
- Parsing JSON output
- Reading and analyzing multiple markdown documents
- Generating complex task lists with dependencies
- Creating validation reports

These activities are outside my scope as a filetree directory structure assistant.

If you're looking to **visualize the directory structure** for your Teacher CRUD feature based on the information in your tasks.md file, I can help with that. Would you like me to:

1. Create a proposed directory structure for the `web-client` project showing where all the files mentioned in tasks.md should be located?
2. Show the complete filetree for the Teacher CRUD feature implementation?

Please clarify what specific directory structure assistance you need, and I'll be happy to help with that aspect.
