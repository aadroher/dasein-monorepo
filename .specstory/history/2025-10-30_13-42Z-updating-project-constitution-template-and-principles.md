I'll help you update the project constitution following the instructions in the prompt. Let me start by examining the current workspace structure and locating the constitution template. Now let me examine the repository context to understand the project better and identify any related templates that need to be checked for consistency. Let me read the templates to understand the current project structure and requirements: Now I need to analyze the current constitution to identify placeholders and understand what needs to be filled in. Looking at the constitution, I can see:

1. The document has partially filled content for principles I-XII but some are incomplete
2. There are template placeholders like `[PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]`, `[SECTION_2_NAME]`, etc.
3. The document has a mix of completed principles and template placeholders

Let me examine what's already defined and what needs completion:

Can you check for typos in `constitution.md`?

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

I'll check the `constitution.md` file for typos. Let me read through the entire document carefully. I found several typos and grammatical issues in the `constitution.md` file. Let me fix them: 
```

```

```

```

```
I've found and corrected the following typos in the `constitution.md` file:

1. **"Centralised" → "Centralized"** - Changed to American English spelling for consistency
2. **"chose" → "choose"** - Corrected verb tense ("We will choose" instead of "We will chose")
3. **"accessibilty" → "accessibility"** - Fixed missing 'i'
4. **"easyly" → "easily"** - Corrected spelling
5. **"performances penalty" → "performance penalty"** - Removed unnecessary 's' (performance is uncountable in this context)

All the typos have been fixed. The document now has proper spelling and grammar throughout.
