# Importing TypeScript files with extensions issue (2025-11-09 20:11Z)

_**User (2025-11-09 20:16Z)**_

@workspace /explain An import path can only end with a '.tsx' extension when 'allowImportingTsExtensions' is enabled.

**Analyzing TypeScript Import Error**

It seems the user is dealing with an import issue in their TypeScript project. They've mentioned a fragment that looks like an incomplete statement. The error message suggests they're trying to include a `.tsx` file but haven’t enabled `allowImportingTsExtensions`. They might have forgotten to complete the import syntax or mixed up file extensions. I’d recommend removing the file extension from their import statement or enabling the compiler option to allow that. Let’s help them clarify their imports!**Clarifying TypeScript Fixes**

I need to ask a clarifying question, even if it's minimal, as the error seems straightforward. I'll stick to developer instructions that emphasize concise and impersonal language, using Markdown for formatting. I’ll provide the corrected import for `main.tsx`, including the path comment and a possible `tsconfig` change. It’s important to format the code block correctly, and I might note that if using ESNext with a bundler like Vite, you could skip the extension. Let’s make this helpful!The error occurs because TypeScript forbids importing with a .ts or .tsx extension unless tsconfig has "allowImportingTsExtensions": true. Easiest fix: drop the extension in the import.

Option 1 (recommended):
````tsx
// ...existing code...
import App from "./App";
// ...existing code...
````

Option 2 (less common): add to tsconfig.json:
````json
// ...existing code...
{
  // ...existing code...
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...existing code...
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true
  }
}
// ...existing code...
````

Use Option 1 unless you have a strong reason to allow explicit .tsx imports. Removing the extension keeps compatibility with tooling and future transpilation.

Let me know if the App file is actually App.ts rather than App.tsx. GitHub Copilot

Do you know how can I configure my project so that when I press CMD + . the option to autofix this is shown?

1. Install the ESLint extension so Quick Fix (⌘.) can show ESLint auto-fix actions.
2. Ensure an .eslintrc configuration exists at your workspace root (Quick Fix surfaces its code actions from this).
3. Open the file with the problem (e.g. main.tsx) and place the cursor on the highlighted issue.
4. Trigger Quick Fix.

```json
[
	{
		"type": "command",
		"details": {
			"key": "editor.action.quickFix"
		}
	}
]
```
5. Choose the ESLint fix (e.g. Fix all auto-fixable problems or a specific suggestion). If you want to directly apply all available fixes, use Auto Fix.

```json
[
	{
		"type": "command",
		"details": {
			"key": "editor.action.autoFix"
		}
	}
]
```
