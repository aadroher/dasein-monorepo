I'll help you generate the tasks.md file following the instructions in the prompt. Let me start by running the prerequisites check script. Now let me load the required and available documents from the feature directory. Now let me check if there are any contract files and read the template: Now let me read more of the data-model and contracts to understand the complete component structure: Perfect! Now I have all the information needed to generate the tasks.md file. Let me create it based on the user stories from spec.md, organized by user story as required. Perfect! I've successfully generated the `tasks.md` file for the Teacher Management Page Redesign feature. Here's a summary:

## Summary

**Generated File**: `tasks.md`

### Task Breakdown

- **Total Tasks**: 47
- **Parallelizable Tasks**: 22 (marked with [P])
- **Phases**: 6

### Tasks per User Story

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: 2 tasks - Heroicons installation and test infrastructure verification
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: 8 tasks - Reusable design system components (IconButton, CommonLayout, PageHeader, AppLogo) with tests
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: 12 tasks - Table layout with inline icon actions
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: 9 tasks - Common application header with logo
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: 6 tasks - Improved form spacing
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: 10 tasks - Final validation and cross-cutting concerns

### Independent Test Criteria

Each user story has clear acceptance criteria:
- **US1**: Teachers display in list/table format with icon actions on same row
- **US2**: Common header with logo and "Dasein" branding, smaller "Teachers" page heading
- **US3**: Improved spacing in creation form (verified visually and through tests)

### Suggested MVP Scope

**Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3** = 22 tasks (User Story 1 only)
This delivers the core visual improvement: teachers in a clean table layout with inline icon-based actions.

### Format Validation

✅ All tasks follow the required checklist format:
- Checkbox prefix: `- [ ]`
- Task ID: T001, T002, etc.
- [P] marker where parallelizable
- [Story] label for user story phases (US1, US2, US3)
- Clear descriptions with exact file paths

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

The document identifies 22 parallelizable tasks and provides specific examples for:
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 7 tasks can run in parallel
- User Story 1 Tests: 6 test updates can run in parallel
- User Story 1 Implementation: 3 component tasks can run in parallel
