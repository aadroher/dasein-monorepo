I'll follow the instructions to generate Phase 5 of the tasks.md file. Let me start by running the prerequisites check and loading the necessary documents. Now I can see the current state of the `tasks.md` file. The user is asking me to follow the instructions for "Phase 5" which refers to User Story 3 (Adaptive Layout for Desktop and Tablet). I can see that Phase 5 tasks (T049-T053) are currently not marked as complete. Let me check what work has been done and complete Phase 5.

Let me first check the current state of the relevant files: I can see that MainContainer already has some responsive classes, but Phase 5 tasks are not yet complete. Let me create a todo list and implement the remaining Phase 5 tasks: Looking at the MainContainer, it already has responsive classes. Let me verify it meets the Phase 5 requirements and then move on to creating the other components: 
```

```
Now let me create the Grid component: Now let me check the existing navigation component to understand how to create the responsive navigation: Now let me create a responsive navigation component with mobile menu: Let me fix those lint errors: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me update the layout index to export these components: 
```

```
Now let me create the responsive layout test: Now let me create the E2E test for navigation condensation: Now let me update the `tasks.md` file to mark Phase 5 tasks as complete: 
```

```
Now let me run the integration tests to verify everything works: Let me fix that test - the inner div doesn't have w-full, but the container does: 
```

```
Perfect! Now let me check if there are any compilation errors: Excellent! Now let me mark the final task as complete and provide a summary: [object Object]
