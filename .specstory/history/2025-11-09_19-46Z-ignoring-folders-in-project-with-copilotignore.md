# Ignoring folders in project with .copilotignore (2025-11-09 19:46Z)

_**User (2025-11-09 19:55Z)**_

I am speaking to you through the VSCode chat. Do you know how to specify that I would like you to ignore certain folders inside this project?

Yes! To make me ignore certain folders in your project, you can use a `.copilotignore` file at the root of your workspace.

Create a file called `.copilotignore` in `` and add the folders/files you want me to ignore using the same syntax as `.gitignore`:

```plaintext
# Dependencies
node_modules/
**/node_modules/

# Build outputs
dist/
build/
**/dist/
**/build/

# Test coverage
coverage/
**/coverage/

# OS files
.DS_Store
```

The patterns work like `.gitignore`:
- `node_modules/` - ignores folder at root
- `**/node_modules/` - ignores folder anywhere in the project
- `*.log` - ignores all `.log` files
- `!important.log` - exception to include this file

After creating the file, I'll respect these ignore rules when analyzing your workspace context.
